# ULPLoRa with BMP180 Integration

This repository contains code libraries and documentation for integrating the ULPLoRa board with the BMP180 sensor. The ULPLoRa board, a combination of an Arduino Pro Mini with an RFM95W LoRa module, provides a versatile platform for wireless communication, while the BMP180 sensor offers precise atmospheric pressure measurements.

## Features

- **ULPLoRa Board:** Utilizes the MCCI LoRaWAN LMIC library for LoRaWAN communication.
- **BMP180 Sensor:** Interfaced with the Adafruit BMP085 library for sensor data acquisition.
- **ChirpStack Integration:** Enables seamless connectivity with the ChirpStack server for LoRaWAN network management.
- **InfluxDB and Grafana Integration:** Facilitates data storage in InfluxDB and visualization in Grafana for effective monitoring and analysis.
